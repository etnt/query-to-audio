# Query to Audio Data

This script takes a user query, sends it to an Vectorshift API, and saves the returned audio-related data.

The API is accessing a Vectorshift pipeline such as:

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd query-to-audio
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   make
   ```

4. Make sure your Vectorshift API key is setup as an environment variable.
   ```
   QUERY_TO_AUDIO_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

Run the script with:

```
./venv/bin/python3 query_to_audio.py
```

You will be prompted to enter your query. After entering the query, the script will send it to the API, receive a response containing audio-related data, and save it as 'output_audio.wav' in the current directory and play it.

## Example

```bash
‚ùØ ./venv/bin/python3 query_to_audio.py 
Enter your query: Who killed the Calydonian boar?
Audio data saved as output_audio.wav
